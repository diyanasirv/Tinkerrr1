    const symptoms = {
      nausea: `
        <strong>Nausea</strong> is one of the most common symptoms of pregnancy, often referred to as morning sickness. It is caused by the rapid increase in hormones like hCG and estrogen. Nausea typically starts around the 6th week of pregnancy and subsides by the second trimester, though some women may experience it throughout pregnancy.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Tips for relief:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Eat small, frequent meals (e.g., crackers, toast, or bananas).</li>
          <li>Avoid greasy, spicy, or strong-smelling foods.</li>
          <li>Stay hydrated with water, ginger tea, or electrolyte drinks.</li>
          <li>Try acupressure wristbands or vitamin B6 supplements.</li>
          <li>Rest and avoid sudden movements.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>When to seek medical advice:</strong> If nausea is severe, persistent, or accompanied by vomiting that prevents you from keeping food or liquids down, consult your doctor. This could indicate hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition requiring medical treatment.
      `,
      vision_changes: `
        <strong>Blurred vision or vision changes</strong> during pregnancy can occur due to hormonal shifts, fluid retention, or changes in blood pressure. These changes are usually temporary but should be monitored closely.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Tips for relief:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Rest your eyes regularly, especially if you spend time on screens.</li>
          <li>Stay hydrated to reduce fluid retention.</li>
          <li>Use artificial tears to relieve dry eyes.</li>
          <li>Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from bright light.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>When to seek medical advice:</strong> If you experience sudden vision changes, double vision, or flashes of light, seek immediate medical attention. These could be signs of preeclampsia or other serious conditions.
      `,
      fatigue: `
        <strong>Fatigue</strong> is a common symptom in early pregnancy due to hormonal changes, increased blood production, and the body's effort to support the growing baby. It often improves in the second trimester but may return in the third trimester.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Tips for relief:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Prioritize rest and take short naps during the day.</li>

          <li>Stay hydrated and avoid caffeine.</li>
          <li>Engage in light exercise like walking or prenatal yoga.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>When to seek medical advice:</strong> If fatigue is severe or accompanied by dizziness, pale skin, or shortness of breath, consult your doctor to rule out anemia or other conditions.
      `,
      headache: `
        <strong>Headaches</strong> during pregnancy can result from hormonal changes, stress, dehydration, or low blood sugar. They are most common in the first and third trimesters.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Tips for relief:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Drink plenty of water and eat small, frequent meals.</li>

      `,
      swelling: `
        <strong>Swelling</strong> (edema) in the feet, ankles, and hands is common during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. It is caused by increased fluid retention and pressure on blood vessels.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Tips for relief:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Elevate your legs when sitting or lying down.</li>

        </ul>

      `,
      frequent_urination: `
        <strong>Frequent urination</strong> is a common symptom caused by hormonal changes and increased pressure on the bladder as the baby grows. It is most common in the first and third trimesters.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Tips for relief:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Avoid caffeine, which can act as a diuretic.</li>
          <li>Empty your bladder completely when using the restroom.</li>
          <li>Practice pelvic floor exercises (Kegels) to strengthen bladder control.</li>
          <li>Limit fluid intake before bedtime to reduce nighttime trips.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>When to seek medical advice:</strong> If frequent urination is accompanied by pain, burning, or cloudy urine, consult your doctor. These could be signs of a urinary tract infection.
      `,
      constipation: `
        <strong>Constipation</strong> is common during pregnancy due to hormonal changes that slow digestion and the pressure of the growing uterus on the intestines.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Tips for relief:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase your fiber intake by eating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.</li>

          <li>Try prunes or prune juice to stimulate bowel movements.</li>
          <li>Avoid processed foods and excessive dairy.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>When to seek medical advice:</strong> If constipation is severe or accompanied by abdominal pain, consult your doctor. They may recommend safe stool softeners or laxatives.
      `,
      implantation_bleeding: `
        <strong>Implantation bleeding</strong> is light spotting that occurs when the fertilized egg attaches to the uterine lining, typically around 6-12 days after ovulation. It is usually harmless and lasts for a short time.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Tips for relief:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Rest and avoid strenuous activities.</li>
          <li>Use a panty liner to manage light spotting.</li>
          <li>Stay hydrated and monitor the bleeding.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>When to seek medical advice:</strong> If bleeding is heavy, accompanied by severe cramps, or persists for more than a few days, seek medical advice to rule out complications like miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy.
      `,
      cramping: `
        <strong>Mild cramping</strong> is common as the uterus stretches to accommodate the growing baby. It is usually harmless and similar to menstrual cramps.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Tips for relief:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Stay hydrated and rest.</li>
          <li>Use a warm compress on the lower abdomen.</li>
          <li>Practice gentle stretching or prenatal yoga.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>When to seek medical advice:</strong> If cramping is severe, persistent, or accompanied by bleeding, contact your doctor immediately. These could be signs of preterm labor or other complications.
      `,
      breast_tenderness: `
        <strong>Breast tenderness</strong> is one of the earliest signs of pregnancy caused by hormonal changes. It usually subsides as the pregnancy progresses.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Tips for relief:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Wear a supportive, well-fitting bra without underwires.</li>

          <li>Avoid caffeine and reduce salt intake to minimize swelling.</li>
          <li>Use a gentle moisturizer to prevent dryness.</li>
        </ul>

      `,
      decreased_movements: `
        <strong>Decreased baby movements</strong> in the third trimester could indicate potential complications. It is important to monitor your baby's movements regularly.
        <br><br>
        <strong>What to do:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Perform a kick count by lying down and monitoring movements; you should feel at least 10 movements in 2 hours.</li>
          <li>Stay hydrated and try drinking a cold beverage or eating a snack to stimulate movement.</li>
          <li>Change positions or gently poke your belly to encourage movement.</li>
        </ul>

      `,
      heartburn: `
        <strong>Heartburn</strong> is a common symptom during pregnancy caused by hormonal changes that relax the valve between the stomach and esophagus, allowing stomach acid to rise. It is most common in the second and third trimesters as the growing uterus puts pressure on the stomach.

          <li>Avoid lying down immediately after eating; wait at least 2-3 hours.</li>
          <li>Sleep with your head elevated using pillows to prevent acid reflux at night.</li>
          <li>Drink milk or eat yogurt to neutralize stomach acid.</li>
